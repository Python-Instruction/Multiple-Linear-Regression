Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple linear regression is used to estimate the relationship between two or more independent variables and one dependent variable.

Example-The selling price of a house can depend on the desirability of the location, the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, the year the house was built, the square 
footage of the lot and a number of other factors.

Here

Dependents variable ->

Selling price of a house

Independent variable->

Location, Number of bathrooms ,  year the house build, square footage and other factors

The Formula for Multiple Linear Regression Is

yi​ = β0​ + β1​xi1​ + β2​xi2 ​+ ... + βp​xip​ + ϵ

where, for i=n observations:

yi​ = dependent variable

xi ​= expanatory variables

β0​ = y-intercept (constant term)

βp​ = slope coefficients for each explanatory variable

ϵ  = the model’s error term (also known as the residuals)​
